        Before you create a deployment you need to upload the required files for that deployment. To do it, you need to first upload each file to this endpoint. Once that's completed, you can create a new deployment with the uploaded files. The file content must be placed inside the body of the request. In the case of a successful response you'll receive a status code 200 with an empty body.
