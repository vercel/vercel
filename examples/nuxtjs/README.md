# Nuxt.js Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) app that can be deployed with ZEIT Now and zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Nuxt.js project with ZEIT Now.

[![Deploy with ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/button)](https://zeit.co/new/project?template=https://github.com/zeit/now/tree/master/examples/nuxtjs)

_Live Example: https://nuxtjs.now-examples.now.sh_

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Nuxt.js deployed with ZEIT Now, you can use the [Create-Nuxt-App CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-nuxt-app) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx create-nuxt-app my-app
```

> The only change made is to amend the output directory in `nuxt.config.js` to `"/public"`.

### Deploying From Your Terminal

You can deploy your new Nuxt.js project with a single command from your terminal using [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download):

```shell
$ now
```
