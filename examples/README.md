# Vercel Examples

To get started using any of these examples as your own project, [install Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) and use either of the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
vercel init                    # Pick an example in the CLI
vercel init <example>          # Create a new project from a specific <example>
vercel init <example> <name>   # Create a new project from a specific <example> with a different folder <name>
```

Deploying your project can be done with **a single command**:

```sh
vercel                         # Deploy your project with the CLI
```

With the `vercel` command, your project will be built and served by Vercel, providing you with a URL that can be shared immediately.

## How to Contribute
