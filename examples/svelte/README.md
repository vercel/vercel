# Svelte

This directory is a brief example of a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) site that can be deployed to Vercel with zero-configuration. If you need to use API Routes, we recommend using our [SvelteKit example](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/sveltekit).

## Deploy Your Own

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/framework-boilerplates/svelte&template=svelte)

_Live Example: https://svelte.vercel.app_

## Getting Started

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-svelte-project
cd my-svelte-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Need an official Svelte framework?

Check out [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit#readme), which is also powered by Vite. Deploys seamlessly to Vercel, with out of the box support for TypeScript, SCSS, and Less, and easily-added support for mdsvex, GraphQL, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, and more.
