# Stencil Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) app that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Stencil project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/stencil&template=stencil)

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Stencil deployed with Vercel, you can use the [Stencil project initializer](https://stenciljs.com/docs/getting-started#starting-a-new-project) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npm init stencil
```
