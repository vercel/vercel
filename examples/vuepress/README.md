# VuePress Example

This directory is a brief example of a [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) app that can be deployed with ZEIT Now and zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own VuePress project with ZEIT Now.

[![Deploy with ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/button)](https://zeit.co/new/project?template=https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/vuepress)

_Live Example: https://vuepress.now-examples.now.sh_

### How We Created This Example

To get started with VuePress deployed with ZEIT Now, you can use the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init vuepress
```

> The only change made is to add `dest: "/public"` to the `config.js` file.

### Deploying From Your Terminal

You can deploy your new VuePress project with a single command from your terminal using [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download):

```shell
$ now
```
