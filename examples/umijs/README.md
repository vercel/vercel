# UmiJS Example

This directory is a brief example of a [UmiJS](https://umijs.org/) app that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own UmiJS project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/master/examples/umijs)

_Live Example: https://umijs.now-examples.now.sh_

### How We Created This Example

To get started with UmiJS deployed with Vercel, you can use the [Umi](https://github.com/umijs/umi) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ mkdir app-name && cd app-name
$ yarn create @umijs/umi-app
```

### Deploying From Your Terminal

You can deploy your new UmiJS project with a single command from your terminal using [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download):

```shell
$ vercel
```
