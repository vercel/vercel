# RedwoodJS Example

This directory is a brief example of a [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) app with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own RedwoodJS project, along with Serverless Functions, with Vercel.

```
