# RedwoodJS Example

This directory is a brief example of a [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) app with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions) that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own RedwoodJS project, along with Serverless Functions, with Vercel.

### How We Created This Example

```shell
$ yarn create redwood-app ./my-redwood-app
```
