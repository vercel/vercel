# mastra

Welcome to your new [Mastra](https://mastra.ai/) project! We're excited to see what you'll build.

## Getting Started

Start the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4111](http://localhost:4111) in your browser to access [Mastra Studio](https://mastra.ai/docs/getting-started/studio). It provides an interactive UI for building and testing your agents, along with a REST API that exposes your Mastra application as a local service. This lets you start building without worrying about integration right away.

You can start editing files inside the `src/mastra` directory. The development server will automatically reload whenever you make changes.

## Deploy on Mastra Cloud

[Mastra Cloud](https://cloud.mastra.ai/) gives you a serverless agent environment with atomic deployments. Access your agents from anywhere and monitor performance. Make sure they don't go off the rails with evals and tracing.
