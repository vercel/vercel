# Deployment failed

## Why This Error Occurred

When deploying this project, there was not a successful deployment into the `READY` state.

## How to Fix It

This is a generic error to catch problems in the deployment. The error is likely to vary depending on the deployment and the conditions at the time.

Try looking in the logs for information about the deployment and the failure, this could be done at (vercel.com)[https://vercel.com]. You can also use the `vc logs` command to display the build logs for the deployment.

This might not be a permanent error and retrying the deployment might also resolve it.
