# Not authorized to access domain

#### Why This Error Occurred

You tried to add or update a domain's configuration, but you don't have permission to modify the domain.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

If you or your team owns the domain, then you are most likely in the wrong context. Use `vercel switch` to select the team or user that owns the domain.
