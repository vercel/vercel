'@vercel/edge': patch
---

This package was introduced to add helpful methods related to Edge Functions.

Nowadays, as much as Node.js and Edge support the same primitives, there is no necessity to continue maintaining a separate package.

We're going to use [@vercel/functions](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/packages/functions) for all the runtimes!
