# Marko.js Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Marko.js](https://markojs.com/) app that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example

To get started with Marko.js on Now, you can use the [Marko CLI](https://github.com/marko-js/cli) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ marko create my-project
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Marko.js example with just a single command:
