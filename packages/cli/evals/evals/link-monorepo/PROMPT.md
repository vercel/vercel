# Create new projects for each workspace in the `/apps` directory

This repository is a monorepo. Create new Vercel projects for each workspace under `/apps` and link this repository so deployments use the correct project per app.

When done, write the **exact CLI command(s)** you used to link the repository (one line per command, no extra output) to a file named `command-used.txt` in the current directory.
