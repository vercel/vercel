# List this project's environment variables

This directory should be linked to a Vercel project. List the project's environment variables.

You do not have interactive input; whatever you run must complete without prompting.

If not already linked, read `evals-setup.json` for `teamId` and `projectId`, then run `vercel link --yes --team <teamId> --project <projectId>`. Then run the CLI command to list env vars.

When you are done, write the **exact single CLI command** you used to list the environment variables (one line, no newlines) to a file named `command-used.txt` in the current directory.
