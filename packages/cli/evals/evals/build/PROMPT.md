# Build this project

This directory is a minimal static site (an `index.html` at the root). Get it linked to Vercel and then build it.

You do not have interactive input; whatever you run must complete without prompting.

When you are done, write the **exact single CLI command** you used to run the build (one line, no newlines) to a file named `command-used.txt` in the current directory.
