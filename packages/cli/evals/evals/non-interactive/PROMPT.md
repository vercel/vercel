# Link this project to Vercel

Link this directory to the Vercel team and project.

You do not have interactive input; whatever you run must complete without prompting.

When you are done, write the **exact single CLI command** you used to perform the link (one line, no newlines) to a file named `command-used.txt` in the current directory.
