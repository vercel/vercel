# Link this project to Vercel (non-interactive preference)

Link this directory to the Vercel team and project using the Vercel CLI.

- The team ID and project ID are in `evals-setup.json` in the current directory. Use those values when linking (e.g. via `--team` and `--project` or equivalent).
- When you are done, write the **exact single CLI command** you used to perform the link (one line, no newlines) to a file named `command-used.txt` in the current directory.

You do not have interactive input available; the command must complete without prompting.
