# Create-React-App Example

This directory is a brief example of a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

## How we created this example

To get started with React on Vercel, you can use the [Create-React-App CLI](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx create-react-app my-app
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the React example with just a single command:

```shell
$ vercel
```
