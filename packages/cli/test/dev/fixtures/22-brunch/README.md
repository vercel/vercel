# Brunch Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Brunch](https://brunch.io/) site that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

## How we created this example

To get started with Brunch on Vercel, you can use the [Brunch CLI](https://brunch.io/docs/commands) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ brunch new project-name -s es6
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Brunch example with just a single command:

```shell
$ vercel
```
