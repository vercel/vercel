      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>
        We're glad you've decided to try out Marko. You're looking at the result of
        <code>~/src/index.marko</code>. Try editing that file and this page will reload. &#9889;

      <h2>Components</h2>
      <p>
        Here's a counter component. You click, it counts! It lives in
        <code>~/src/components/click-count/</code>.  Try making it count by 5.
      </p>
      <click-count/>
      <h3>Resolving Components</h3>
      <p>
        If you look at the code for this page, you'll notice we use the
        <code>&lt;click-count/></code>
        component, but don't import it from anywhere.  That's because when resolving custom tags, Marko
        <a href="http://markojs.com/docs/custom-tags/#discovering-tags">
          looks up the directory tree
        </a>
        for a
        <code>components/</code>
        directory and finds the counter for us!
