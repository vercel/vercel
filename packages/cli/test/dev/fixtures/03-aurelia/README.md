# Aurelia Example

This directory is a brief example of an [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/) app that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

## How we created this example

To get started with Aurelia on Vercel, you can use the [Aurelia CLI](https://aurelia.io/docs/cli/basics/) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ au new
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Aurelia example with just a single command:

```shell
$ vercel
```
