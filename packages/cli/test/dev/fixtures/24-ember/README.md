# Ember Example

This directory is a brief example of an [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) app that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

## How we created this example

To get started with Ember on Vercel, you can use the [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx ember-cli new ember-project
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Ember example with just a single command:

```shell
$ vercel
```
