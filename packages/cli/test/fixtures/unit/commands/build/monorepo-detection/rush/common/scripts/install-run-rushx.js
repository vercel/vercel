// This script is intended for usage in an automated build environment where the Rush command may not have
// been preinstalled, or may have an unpredictable version.  This script will automatically install the version of Rush
// specified in the rush.json configuration file (if not already installed), and then pass a command-line to the
// rushx command.
//
// An example usage would be:
//
//    node common/scripts/install-run-rushx.js custom-command
