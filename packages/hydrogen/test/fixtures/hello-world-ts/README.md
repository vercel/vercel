# TypeScript Example

Hydrogen is a React framework and SDK that you can use to build fast and dynamic Shopify custom storefronts.

[Check out the docs](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen)

[Run this template on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/Shopify/hydrogen/tree/stackblitz/templates/hello-world-ts)

## Getting started

**Requirements:**

- Node.js version 16.5.0 or higher
- Yarn

Remember to update `hydrogen.config.ts` with your shop's domain and Storefront API token!

## Building for production
