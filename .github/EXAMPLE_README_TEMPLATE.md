# [Name] Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Name](site-link) site that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own [Name] project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/example-directory)

### How We Created This Example

To get started with [Name] on Vercel, you can use the [CLI Tool Used](CLI-link) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ vercel init [Name]]
```

### Deploying From Your Terminal

Once initialized, you can deploy the [Name] example with just a single command:

```shell
$ vercel
```
